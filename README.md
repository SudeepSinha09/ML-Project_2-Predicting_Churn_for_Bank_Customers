## project brief

As part of this project, I cleaned the data, after which I train-tested the data, and then I made models using the train data.

For the given situation, there are three possible models, namely (i) Logistic regression (ii) Random Forest (iii) XGBoost

In order to determine the accuracy of each model, I made predictions based on the train data before making the models, i.e. predicting the models with the train data.

Using these parameters, we found that the accuracy, recall, precision, and f1 scores of logistic regression model, random forest model, XGBoost model.

Result - from all kind of tests we found that the XGBoost model is more accurate as compared to Random forest model and Logistic regression model

##### The model selected - XGBoost
